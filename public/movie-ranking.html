<h1>Best movies according to Anne</h1>

<h2>My top 3 movies of all time</h2>

<hr/>

<h3>The Titanic</h3>
<p>Perfectly romantic movie, with best shot when Rose exits the car</p>

<h3>Red Ridinghood</h3>
<p>Any version really, it is just a great story of how women feel when they become of age</p>

<h3>Cinderella</h3>
<p>Best fairy tale, shows a lot about the suppression of women and how man are supposed to save them. </p>
